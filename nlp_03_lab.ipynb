incident of that evening to you all in his speech well that day when i came out publicly as sai baba that first song i taught the gathering in the garden to which i went from the telugu pandit’s house was', 'manasa bhajare guru charanam', 'dustara bhava sagara taranam', 'i called on all those suffering in the endless round of birth and death to worship the feet of the guru spiritual preceptor the guru who was announcing himself who had come again for taking upon himself the burden of those who find refuge in him that was the very first message of mine to humanity manasa bhajare  worship in the mind i do not need your flower garlands and fruits things that you get for an anna or two they are not genuinely yours give me something that is yours something that is clean and fragrant with the perfume of virtue and innocence and washed in the tears of repentance garlands and fruits you bring as items in the show as an exhibition of your devotion poorer devotees who cannot afford to bring them are humiliated and feel sorry that they are helpless they cannot demonstrate their devotion in the grand way in which you are doing it install the lord in your heart and offer him the fruits of your actions and the flowers of your inner thoughts and feelings that is the worship i like most the devotion i appreciate most', '1reeducation of man persists in all eras', 'in shops things are kept in separate packets and each one specialises in some particular article or sets of articles but in an exhibition hundreds of shops join to make all varieties of things available and there is a great deal of windowdressing arrangement and display i have been all these days generally giving individual advice like the packets available in shops and giving answers to individual questions this ‘speech’ today is a new experience for you i am addressing a gathering today but even though it may be new to you for me it is not new i have given advice to large gatherings before though not in this appearance whenever the formless becomes one with form it has to fulfil the mission and it does so in various ways but the one purpose the reeducation of man persists whatever the era the first sixteen years of this life have been as i have often told you the period when divine child sport predominated and the next sixteen is being spent mostly in miracles in order to give joy to this generation joy and contentment are shortlived sensations you have to catch that mood and make it a permanent possession bliss ananda after the thirtysecond year you will see me active more and more in the task of spiritual instruction  teaching erring humanity and in directing the world along the path of truth righteousness peace and love sathya dharma santhi and prema not that i am determined to exclude plays and miracles from my activity after that i only mean that reestablishing dharma correcting the crookedness of the human mind and guiding humanity back to sanathana dharma eternal universal religion will be my task thereafter do not be led away by doubt and vain argument do not question how and whether i can do all this the cowherds of brindavan also doubted whether the little boy krishna who grew in their midst could lift govardana mountain and hold it aloft the thing needed is faith and yet more faith', '2secret of spiritual success', 'once krishna and arjuna were going together along the open road seeing a bird in the sky krishna asked arjuna is that a dove he replied yes it is a dove he asked arjuna is it an eagle’ arjuna replied promptly yes it is an eagle no arjuna it looks like a crow to me is it not a crow asked krishna arjuna replied i am sorry it is a crow beyond a doubt', 'krishna laughed and chided him for agreeing to whatever suggestion was given but arjuna said for me your words are far more weighty than the evidence of my eyes you can make it a crow a dove or an eagle and when you say it is a crow it must be one', 'implicit faith is the secret of spiritual success the lord loves not the devotee but his devotion remember the lord’s grace is like rain pure water falling equally everywhere but its taste gets changed according to the soil through which it flows so also the lord’s words are sweet to some bitter to others the lord’s ways are mysterious he blessed vidura with the words be destroyed and dussasana with the words live for a thousand years he meant that vidura’s ‘i’ will be destroyed and that the wicked dussasana would have to suffer the ills and tribulations of this world for ten centuries', 'you do not know the real reasons behind the actions of the lord you cannot understand the motives of other men who are almost like you in everything actuated by the same motives and having the same likes and dislikes but yet how easily you discover the motives of one who is far far above the level of humanity how glibly you talk and judge something that is as strange to you as atmosphere to a fish', '3pains indicate birth of new life', 'there are four types of persons the ‘dead’ who deny the lord and declare that they alone exist independent free selfregulating and selfdirected the ‘sick’ who call upon the lord when some calamity befalls them or when they feel temporarily deserted by the usual sources of succour the ‘dull’ who know that god is the eternal companion and watchman but who remember it only off and on when the idea is potent and powerful and lastly the ‘healthy’ who have steady faith in the lord and who live in his comforting creative presence always you proceed from ‘death’ to ‘life’ and from ‘illness’ to ‘health’ by the experience of the buffeting of the world the world is a very essential part of the curriculum of man through the agony of search is born the infant wisdom the pains are worthwhile they indicate the birth of new life from asanthi restlessness you get prasanthi absolute peace from prasanthi to prakanthi bright spiritual illumination and from prakanthi to paramjyothi supreme divine radiance it is like the alternating of night and day this recurrence of joy and grief night and day are twin sisters both are necessary to increase the fertility of the soil to activate and refresh life they are like summer and winter there are some who ask me baba make this summer less hot but in the heat of summer the earth takes in the needed energy from the sun so that when the rains come she may yield a plentiful harvest', '4shine forth in your real nature', '‘cold’ and ‘heat’ are both in the plan of god and yours is only to know this and treat both as valuable thorny plants and thornless plants are both there in nature the wise man knows the value of both he plants the thornless one and surrounds it with the thorny ones so that what he fosters is left unharmed activity can save as well as kill it is like the cat that bites it bites the kitten in order to carry it in its mouth to a place of safety it bites the rat in order to kill and eat become the kitten and work will rescue you like a loving mother become a rat and you are lost god draws the individual toward itself it is the nature of both to have this affinity for they are the same they are like the iron and the magnet but if the iron is rusty or covered with layers of dirt the magnet is unable to attract remove the impediment that is all you have to do shine forth in your real nature and the lord will draw you into his bosom trials and tribulations are the means by which this cleansing is done that is why kunthi prayed to krishna give us always grief so that we may never forget thee they are like the dietary and other restrictions that the doctor prescribes to supplement the effect of the drug of remembrance of god namasmarana', '5do not give up spiritual practice', 'sai is beloved to all people so you can take up any name that gives you joy tastes differ according to the temperament and character one has earned by generations of activity as a living being in this world the proprietor of a coffee house goes to the nearby druggist for a pill to ward off his headache and the druggist when he gets a headache goes to the coffee house for a cup of coffee which he thinks will cure him men are like that the tastes of people differ the wise one says', 'sarvam brahma mayam', 'in god is all', 'another a yogi says all is energy a third who is a devotee says all is the play of bhagavan the lord each according to their taste and according to their progress in spiritual practice do not hurry or ridicule them for they are all pilgrims trudging along the same road spiritual exercise is most required to control the mind and the desires after which it runs if you find that you are not able to succeed do not give up the spiritual exercise but do it more vigorously for it is the subject in which you did not get passing marks that requires special study is it not spiritual exercise means inner cleanliness as well as external cleanliness you do not feel refreshed if you wear unwashed clothes after your bath do you nor do you feel refreshed if you wear washed clothes but skip the bath both are needed the external as well as the internal the bahya and the bhava children believe your words when you say that the policeman will catch them or the ghost will beat them they are full of fear fortitude and faith but having grown old and stuffed your heads with all kinds of doctrines and dogmas and theories and arguments you have now to use your discrimination and discover god the hard way this i will tell you there is no escaping it all creatures have to reach god some day or other by the long route or by the short route', 'one wish leads to another one bond brings about ten others it is in the very nature of human desire for the joy one gets through its satisfaction is imperfect limited temporary pregnant with grief you sow bitter seeds and pray for a harvest of sweetness you wail over the soil the plant the rain what can they do the seeds themselves are diseased defective', 'i do not give ‘speeches’ my talks are more of the conversation type i want that you should follow every word of what i say with reverent attention for your joy is my food you can get joy anandam only by following the advice i give you and this is why i am particular that you should listen carefully and take to heart all that i say this is not a mere lecture wherefrom you do not seek new lessons for life the lord is a mountain of prema love any number of ants carrying away particles of sweetness cannot exhaust his plenty he is an ocean of mercy without a limiting shore devotion is the easiest way to win his grace and also to realise that he pervades everything  in fact is everything', 'total surrender leaving everything to his will is the highest form of devotion once a brahmin was crossing a river bed near which some men were washing clothes finding a nice new silk shawl on his shoulder they fell upon him in a group shouting that it belonged to the palace and had been given to them to be washed but had been stolen and had not been traced the poor brahmin yelled narayana narayana when the blows rained on him so narayana rose from his seat in vaikunta and proceeded forward but in a moment he walked back and resumed his seat much to the surprise of his consort who asked him the reason for the strange behaviour narayana said i wanted to help that poor brahmin who has fallen into a den of scoundrels but he started beating them blow for blow my help is no longer needed', '1conquest of ego needed', 'when devotion is just emerging as a sapling a fence is needed to protect the tender plant that fence is sanathana dharma eternal religion and its rules regulations and restrictions directions and commands when the fruit is green it will not fall even when the gale is furious but when it is fully ripe it drops to the ground even in the silence of the night a small fire will go out in smoke if even a little green is placed on it but the forest fire will reduce to ashes even the greenest tree that impedes its fierce march what is needed is the conquest of the ego the bullock shouts ham hai ham hai i am i am in its egoistic pride so when it is just a few days old you tie it to a post apart from its mother you work it to skin and bones but yet the animal does not learn the lesson of humility even its skin when drawn tightly across a drum resounds egoistically ham ham ham so the skin has to be cut into slender strings and then when the strings are pulled the bullock reveals that it has benefitted by all the punishment it has undergone it murmurs thum thum thum you you you and its ego is gone the mendicant goes along the streets singing the glories of the lord he has the sounding cymbals two of them the eternal duet of goodbad joygrief painpleasure in his right hand and he twangs the tambura a stringed musical instrument of worldly life with his left worldly life is the tune to which his songs have to be adjusted it is the musical note but both the tune and beat are for the purpose of heightening the effect of the song which issues from his mouth the song of the glory of god', '2three types of devotion', 'i remember telling a questioner in maharashtra while in the previous body that there are three types of devotion', 'the bird method where like a bird swooping down upon the ripe fruit on the tree the devotee is too impatient and by that very impatience loses the fruit which falls from his hold', 'the monkey method where like a monkey that pulls toward it one fruit after another and by sheer unsteadiness is not able to decide which fruit it wants the devotee hesitates and changes his aim much too often and thus loses all chances of success', 'the ant method where like the ant that slowly but steadily proceeds toward the sweetness the devotee moves direct with undivided attention toward the lord and wins his grace', 'devotion and faith are the two oars with which you can take the boat across the sea of worldly life a child told its mother when it went to bed at night mother wake me up when i get hungry the mother answered there is no need your hunger will itself wake you so too when the hunger for god comes it will itself activise you and make you seek the food you need god has endowed you with hunger and he supplies the food he has endowed you with illness and he grows the specifics you need your duty is to see that you get the proper hunger and the right illness and use the appropriate food or drug man must be yoked to the worldly life and broken that is the training that will teach that the world is unreal no amount of lectures will make you believe it is a snake unless you actually experience it touch fire and get the sensation of burning there is nothing like it to teach you that fire is to be avoided unless you touch it you will be aware only of its light it is light and heat both just as this world is both true and false that is to say unreal', '3habit of judging others as atheists or theists', 'there is a widely prevalent habit now of judging others and labeling them as theists or atheists what do you know what can you know of the inner working of another’s mind there was once a queen who was a great devotee of rama she felt so sad that her husband the raja never even uttered the name of rama and had no devotion she had vowed that on the first occasion on which she got evidence of his devotion or at least respect for repeating rama’s name she would conduct ritualistic worship in all the temples and feed the poor on a lavish scale then one night while fast asleep the raja uttered rama’s name thrice plaintively and prayerfully she heard this repetition of the name and was happy at the discovery of her husband’s devotion to rama she ordered general rejoicing throughout the kingdom and the feeding of the poor the raja did not know the reason for the celebration for he was told only that it was an order of his wife which the officers carried out similarly a husband may not be aware of the excellence of a wife’s spiritual attainments there is the case of a couple who were proceeding through a thick jungle on pilgrimage to an inaccessible shrine the husband saw on the foot path a precious stone shining brilliantly when the sun’s rays fell upon it from between the leaves he hastily threw some sand over it with a movement of his foot so that his wife may not be tempted to pick it up and become a slave to the tinsel the wife saw the gesture and chided the husband for still retaining in his mind a distinction between sand and diamond for her both were the same', '4keep the name as constant as breathing', 'the raja who spoke the sacred name of rama in his sleep felt very sorry according to the story that he let rama’s name out of his mouth for he believed that no one should know of his ‘love’ for rama there are many who will not shout about their guru or their favourite name and form but whether you declare them to others or not keep them ever in your consciousness repetition of rama or any other name must be as constant as breathing for this practice is essential a person once told dr johnson the famous english thinker that he could seldom get time to recite the name of god what with the hundreds of things he had to do from morning till nightfall and even far into the night dr johnson replied with another question he asked how millions of people found space to live upon the face of the earth which is twothirds water and the rest is too full of mountains deserts forests icy regions river beds marshes and similar impossible areas the questioner said that man somehow struggled to find living space so too said dr johnson man must somehow find a few minutes a day for prayer to the lord', '5example of the highest type of detachment', 'devotion and the attitude of surrender that is its final fruits will give you great courage to meet any emergency such courage is what is called renunciation the story of mohajith a prince is a good example of this highest type of detachment mohajith went to a sage in the forest and sought guidance in the spiritual path the sage asked him whether he had conquered attachment as his name indicated the prince said that not only he but everyone in his kingdom had so the sage started to test the truth of this claim the sage took the prince’s robes soaked them in blood and hastened to the palace gate with the gruesome story of the murder of the prince by some ruffians in the jungle the maid whom he met refused to hurry with the news to the royal apartments because she said he was born and he died what is the special urgency of this news that i should interrupt my regular routine and run to the king and queen when at last he got an audience and was able to communicate the sad news to the prince’s father the king who sat unruffled whispering to himself the bird flew off the tree on which it had alighted to take rest the queen too was unmoved she told the sage that this earth is a caravanserai where men come and stay for the night and when dawn breaks one by one they tramp their different ways kith and kin are the words we use for attachment to the travelers cultivated in the caravanserai during the short term of acquaintance the wife of the dead prince was also unaffected she said husband and wife are like two pieces of wood drifting down a flooded river they float near each other for some time and when some current comes between they are parted each must move on to the sea at its own rate and in its own time there is no need to grieve over the parting of the two it is in the very nature of nature that it should be so the sage was overjoyed to see this steady and sincere dispassion in the rulers and the ruled he came back to the forest and told the prince that while he was away a hostile army had invaded his kingdom and slain the entire royal family and captured his kingdom and enslaved his subjects the prince took the news calmly and said all this is bubble impermanent flimsy let it go the way of the bubble guide me to reach the infinite the imperishable', '6grow with selfrespect and dignity', 'such courage comes out of the grace of the lord it needs generations of learning and struggle meanwhile you must start with the first step the cleansing of the mind and the cultivation of virtue even if you do not start with that step at least do not laugh at those who do and discourage them do at least this much then do not depend upon others for doing your work like attending to your personal wants do them yourself that is real freedom again never accept anything ‘free’ from others pay it back in service or work that will make you selfrespecting individuals receiving a favour means getting bound to the giver grow with selfrespect and dignity that is the best service you can do to yourself', '7there is no seniority or juniority among devotees', '‘uncle’ moon is ‘uncle’ to all the children of the world so also the lord is everyone’s father in whose property everyone can claim a share but in order to get it you must reach a certain age a certain standard of intelligence and discrimination the infirm and the idiotic he will not consider fit to receive property his property is grace love prema but if you have discrimination and renunciation you can claim your share as of right bring devotion and lay it here and take from here spiritual strength the more such business is done the more pleased am i bring what you have namely your sorrows and griefs worries and anxieties and take from me joy and peace courage and confidence in my view there is no seniority or juniority among devotees the mother spends more time tending the sickly child she just asks the older children to look after themselves but she feeds the infant with her own hand that does not mean that she has no love toward the grownups so too do not think that because i do not ostensibly pay more attention to one person that person is beyond the ken of my prema note this also in this avatar divine incarnation the wicked will not be destroyed they will be corrected and reformed and educated and led back to the path from which they have strayed the whiteant infested tree will not be cut it will be saved again this avatar will not select some place other than the place where the nativity took place for the centre of its divine sports miracle powers and divine instruction this tree shall not be transplanted it will grow where it first rose from the earth another speciality is this the avatar has no affinity or attachment in its career to members of the family wherein it appeared unlike the appearances as rama krishna etc where the life was played out mostly among and for the family members this avatar is only for the devotees noble souls and aspirants on it has no recitation of holy name meditation or yoga practising union with god it knows no worship it will not pray to anything for it is the highest it only teaches you to worship and pray to a worldly person a godintoxicated man will appear mad and the person will laugh at him for it but to the godintoxicated man the worldly appear insane foolish misled blind of all the insanities that harass people godmadness is the least harmful the most beneficial the world has suffered untold damage due to its mad rulers and mad guides but nothing but harmony peace brotherliness and love have come out of ‘godmadness’', 'god is supreme energy mahasakthi and the individual being is deluding power mayasakthi he is the genuine the individual being is but the shadow the appearance the delusion even i have to put on deluding power to come into your midst like the policeman who is compelled to wear the dress of the thief so that he can get entry into the gang of thieves to apprehend them and bring them to book', 'the lord cannot come down with his supreme energy unimpaired he has to come with diminished splendour and limited effulgence so that he can become the object of devotion and dedicated service in this world which is impermanent and ever transforming the immanent power of the lord is the only permanent and fixed entity in order to realise the eternal and the true one has perforce to attach oneself to that source and sustenance there is no escape from this path it is the destiny of one and all irrespective of age or scholarship clime or caste sex or status while proceeding along the road you can watch your shadow falling on mud or dirt hollow or mound thorn or sand wet or dry patches of land you are unaffected by the fate of your shadow is it not nor is the shadow made dirty thereby it does not worry in the least where it falls or what it wades through we know that the shadow and its experiences are not eternal or true similarly you must get convinced that you are but the shadow of the absolute you are essentially not this you but the absolute itself that is the remedy for sorrow travail and pain', '1the first step in spiritual discipline', 'of course it is only at the end of a long and systematic process of spiritual practice that you will get fixed in the truth until then you are apt to identify yourself with this body and forget that the body which casts a shadow is itself a shadow the first step in spiritual practice is adherence to dharma righteousness in every individual and social act the dharma that is followed in relation to the objective world will automatically lead on to dharma in the spiritual field also only you must stick to it through thick and thin when aswathama in the blindness of his fury slaughtered the children of the pandavas arjuna who caught him prisoner threatened to cut off his head but droupadi the bereaved mother interceded to save him she said it was not dharma to return murder for murder to slay the son of one’s own guru such steadfastness is needed in the path of dharma that alone is the sign of true surrender let the will of the lord prevail one’s duty is but to connect oneself with the current of his grace while in jail the prisoner cannot call even his clothes his own so too while in this jail serving your term what can you call your own he gives you food and clothing he lets you go when the sentence ends or perhaps sooner if he is pleased by your behaviour while in prison', '2keep the faith in the lord undiminished', 'the greatest obstacle on the path of surrender is egoism and mineness or possessiveness it is something that has been inherent in your personality since ages sending its tentacles deeper and deeper with the experience of every succeeding life it can be removed only by the twin detergents of discrimination and renunciation devotion is the water to wash away this dirt of ages and the soap of repetition of god’s name meditation and communion yoga will help to remove it quicker and more effectively the slow and the steady will surely win this race walking is the safest method of travel though it may be condemned as slow quicker means of travel mean disaster the quicker the means the greater the risk of disaster you should eat only as much as you feel hunger for more will cause disorder so proceed step by step in spiritual effort making sure of one step before you take another do not slide back two paces when you go one pace forward', 'but even the first step will be unsteady if you have no faith so cultivate faith sathyabama once asked krishna why are you doing things like ordinary men yudhistira the eldest of the pandavas is the best of the brothers but you hobnob always with arjuna whose reputation is not above board her faith was not steady what do people know of the motives that prompt the lord and his actions some found fault with narada for repeating the name of the lord always without intermission but until merging in the absolute occurs the name has to be used the idea of separation will end only with mergence not before that do not waver or doubt when once you are convinced seek to understand and satisfy yourself after that do not be misled when the sun is over your head there will be no shadow similarly when faith is steady in your head it should not cast any shadow of doubt when man loses his way and strays into the wilderness believing that he is the body or the qualities or the object then the avatar comes to warn and guide keep the faith in the lord undiminished you can then safely move about in the world no harm can come to you be like the village women with pots over their heads one over the other keeping balance even while talking and walking along the winding lane they do not forget or ignore the burden or the goal they are vigilant conscious of the hardships on the way the stones and the pits it is inner concentration that pays dividends', '3one should depart the world with a smile', 'everyone has to make their exit some day that moment should not be a moment of anguish one should depart gracefully with a smile and a bow in order to do that a lot of preparation is necessary to depart leaving all that has been accumulated during a long lifetime is a hard task so prepare for it by discarding attachment to one thing after another from now on you see many things in dreams and many things are acquired by you during dreams power pelf status reputation but when you awake you do not weep over the loss even though for the duration of the dream all that was very real and gave you real satisfaction and joy that was a dream you tell yourself what prevents you from treating with similar nonchalance the possessions gathered during the waking stage of your life cultivate that attitude and you can depart with a smile whenever the curtain falls on this dreamland stage', '4pray to the lord to show you the way', 'in order to bring conviction to you in all this it is best you approach a guru spiritual preceptor who knows the truth by experience and whose daily activities words and thoughts reflect this realisation the guru is called so because the letter gu signifies gunatheetha  one who has transcended the three gunas qualities the thamasic the rajasic and even the sathwic ignorant passionate and virtuous  and the letter ru signifies one who is rupa varjitha one who has grasped the formless aspect of godhead of course one could come to that stage only through the sublimation of the lower into the higher qualities and the steady and conscious ignoring of the part played by mere name and form', 'in the preliminary stages of spiritual discipline name form and quality all have their part to play in the moulding of the spirit the guru destroys the illusion and sheds light his presence is cool and comforting that is why this day a fullmoon day is allotted for paying due honour to the guru moreover the moon is the presiding deity of the mind and the fullmoon day is the day on which the mind has become fully beneficent of course you must know what you have lost so that you may start on the search to recover it the guru has very often to tell you that you have forgotten your real name or that you have lost the most precious part of yourself and yet are unaware of the loss the guru is the physician for the illness that brings about the suffering of alternate birth and death he is an adept at the treatment needed for the cure if you do not get such a guru pray to the lord himself to show you the way and he will surely come to your rescue', 'the mind must become the servant of the intellect not the slave of the senses it must discriminate and detach itself from the body like the ripe tamarind fruit which becomes loose inside the shell it must be unattached to this shell this casement called body strike a green tamarind fruit with a stone and you cause harm to the pulp inside but strike the ripe fruit and see what happens it is the dry rind that falls off nothing affects the pulp or the seed the ripe aspirant does not feel the blows of fate or fortune it is the unripe man who is wounded by every blow', 'a convention of the workers of the divine life mission must include all humanity for no one is outside its pale and all are plodding along the road to the realisation of the divinity that is immanent in each the mission on which every individual has come is to merge the individuality in the universal the life that each being is leading is saturated with the divine existence sath is derived from the source of all existence brahman supreme reality itself consciousness chith is derived from the source of all consciousness brahman itself bliss ananda is derived from the source of all bliss brahman itself you are all sathchithananda swarupa embodiments of existenceconsciousnessbliss but you are unaware of it and imagine yourself to be this individual or that subjected to this limitation or that this is the myth that must be exploded in order that divine life may start', 'it is the divine that inspires that activates that leads and fulfills the life of each being however simple or complex its physical structure may be from the atom to the universe every single entity is moving toward the estuary where it merges in the sea of bliss divine life is the very breath of all beings it consists of truth love and nonviolence sathya prema and ahimsa for how can any one be false to another when there is no other at all falsehood comes out of fear when there is no second there is no fear at all no one is loved more than the self so when all is the selfsame self all is loved as the self is loved as for violence who is to injure whom when all are but one', '1faith in the almighty will remove anxiety', 'how to lead a divine life no special membership entitles you to it every struggle to realise the unity behind all the multiplicity is a step on the path of divine life you have to churn the milk if you wish to separate and identify the butter that is immanent in it so too you have to carry on certain processes of thought and action in order to get to the hard core of faith that this world is a funny mixture of real and unreal that it is in fact false mithya divine life does not admit of the slightest dross in character or delusion in intellect so people dedicated to it must emphasise this by precept and example wipe out the root causes of anxiety and fear and ignorance then only can your true personality shine forth anxiety is removed by faith in the lord the faith that tells you that whatever happens is for the best and that the lord’s will be done quiet acceptance is the best armour against anxiety not the acceptance of the heroic', 'sorrow springs from egoism the feeling that you do not deserve to be treated so badly that you are left helpless when egoism goes sorrow disappears ignorance is just a mistake mistaken identity of the body as the self in fact you must each one try to become egoless and then the lord will accept you as his flute once when a number of people were asked by me what they would like to be in the hands of god i got various answers some said the lotus some the conch some the discus but no one mentioned the flute i would advise you to become the flute for then the lord will come to you pick you up put you to his lips and breathe through you out of the hollowness of your heart due to the utter absence of egoism that you have developed he will create captivating music for all creation to enjoy be straight without any will of your own merge your will in the will of god inhale only the breath of god that is divine life that

blamed for their want of faith so too this seshagiri rao here was finding fault with his son and daughters for coming to puttaparthi and himself for long refusing to come one day at bangalore there was a function in the house opposite his for i had gone there during bhajans group singing of devotional songs this man hesitantly crossed the road and peeped into the hall and i went forward and called him and made him sit near me i asked him to come to puttaparthi and invited him to examine and experience he has been with me ever since it is now 18 years since he first came here this is just

inspector rushes in and if it becomes violent the superintendent of police has to be personally present on the scene to quell it if however the situation waxes hot the inspector general has to make himself available is it not this is a situation in which the ig is taking overall charge of the situation the sages savants saints yogis and divine personalities have had their try and they will all be cooperating in the task of reestablishing righteousness and clearing the path for the world attaining absolute peace santhi the greatest defect today is the absence of inquiry into the nature of the self that is the root cause of all this restlessness if you are eager to know the truth about yourself then even if you do not believe in god you will not go astray the pots are all of mud the ornaments are all of gold the clothes are all of yarn there is unity where one saw only diversity the basic substance is one and indivisible that is brahman supreme reality that is the atma which is your own basic substance too this inquiry into the nature of the self is best found in the upanishads just as a river’s flow is regulated by bunds and the flood waters are directed to the sea so too the upanishads regulate and restrict the senses the mind and the intellect and help one to reach the sea and merge individuality in the absolute study the upanishads with a view to act accordingly to put the advice into practice scanning a map or turning over a guidebook will not give you the thrill of the actual visit nor will it give you a fraction of the joy and knowledge of a journey through that land the upanishads and the gita are only maps and guidebooks remember', '2call upon the lord in your own heart', 'there is the story of a rustic who sat among a gathering of devotees and listened to the exposition of the gita  by a great scholar all were wonderstruck by the scholarly commentary the learned disquisition on each word and phrase the rustic though the exposition was very much over his head seemed to attend very closely for he was all the time in tears when at last the scholar asked him why he was weeping he surprised everybody by the sincerity of his devotion he said that he wept at the predicament of the lord who had to sit at the head of the chariot and half turning his neck hold forth so long to convince the dullwitted arjuna how much pain must he be suffering in his neck he asked and wept', 'that was real devotion a sure passport to spiritual victory he had identified himself with the participants in the episode and the whole setting had become alive for him you need not even read the gita or the upanishads you will hear a gita specially designed for you if you call upon the lord in your own heart he is there installed as your own charioteer ask him and he will answer', 'have the form of the lord before you when you sit quietly in a place for meditation and have his name that is any name when you do repetition of a holy name if you do that repetition without that picture or form before you who is to give the answer you cannot be talking all the time to yourself the form will hear and the form will respond all agitations must cease one day is it not meditation on the form and repetition of the name  that is the only means for this task', '3stick to the name and form you like the most', 'the secret is you should be but not be as in sleep when you are aware deep down within you that you are sleep is enveloped in delusion maya awake from that delusion but immerse yourself in this sleep that is the real superconscious state of bliss samadhi repetition of the name and meditation are means by which you can compel even the concretisation of the divine grace in the form and with the name you yearn for the lord has to assume the form you choose the name you fancy in fact you shape him so therefore do not change these two but stick to the ones that please you most whatever the delay or the difficulty do not get discouraged that you are not able to concentrate for long from the very beginning when you learn to ride a bicycle you do not get the skill of keeping the balance immediately you push the cycle along to an open maidan and hop and skip leaning now to one side and now to the other and even fall with the cycle upon you on many an attempt before you are able to ride with skill and never again to worry about the balance automatically you are able to make the necessary adjustments to correct the balance is it not after getting this skill you can ride through the narrow streets and lanes and you do not need an open road you can negotiate your vehicle through the most crowded thoroughfares so too practice will equip you with a concentration that will sustain you in the densest of surroundings and the most difficult situations', '4the best spiritual discipline for the beginners', 'do not be under the impression that i will be angry with you if you do not accept me as the form for meditation i am not concerned at all you have perfect freedom to select the name and form that give you necessary encouragement when you meditate the mind often runs after something else it takes another road you have then to plug that outlet by means of the name and the form and see that the even flow of your thoughts toward the lord is not interrupted if it happens again use the name and the form again quickly do not allow the mind to go beyond the twin bunds this side name and that side form then it will not stray into a third place', 'first when you sit for meditation recite a few verses on the glory of god so that the thoughts that are scattered could be collected then gradually while doing repetition of the name draw before the mind’s eye the form that that name represents when your mind wanders away from the recital of the name take it on to the picture of the form when it wanders away from the picture lead it on to the name let it dwell either on that sweetness or this treated thus it can be easily tamed the imaginary picture you have drawn will get transmuted into the emotional picture dear to the heart and fixed in the memory gradually will come the time when the lord assumes that form in order to fulfil your desire', '5use the body as an instrument for spiritual practice', 'this spiritual practice is called meditation on the lord’s name and form and i advise you all to take it up for it is the best for beginners within a few days you will fall in line and you will taste the joy of concentration after about ten or fifteen minutes in the initial stages and longer after some time of this meditation have some inward contemplation on the peace and contentment you had during the meditation that is to say bring back into your memory the joy you experienced this will help your faith and earnestness', 'then do not get up suddenly and start moving about resuming your avocations loosen the limbs slowly deliberately gradually and then enter upon your usual duties taste the fruits of meditation and learn to relish them that is what i mean by this process of repeated reflection be careful about your physical health also satisfy the demands of nature the car must be given the petrol that it needs otherwise your head might reel and your eyes might get blurred through sheer exhaustion', 'how can thoughts of the lord be stabilised in a weak frame only do not forget the purpose of this body when you are tending it a roadroller is fed with oil and coal and other types of fuel but why is it kept in good trim in order to mend the road is it not similarly remember that you have come embodied so that you might realise the end of this cycle of birth and death for that sake use the body as an instrument', 'flying hither and thither higher and higher the bird has at last to perch on a tree for rest so too even the richest and the most powerful man seeks rest peace santhi peace can be got only in one shop in inner reality the senses will drag you along into a mire which submerges you deeper and deeper in alternate joy and grief that is to say prolonged discontent only contemplation of unity can remove fear rivalry envy greed desire  all feelings that prompt discontent every other avenue can give only pseudocontentment and a day will come when you will throw away all these playthings and toys and cry lord grant me unruffled peace the bandit valmiki prayed so the confirmed atheist too has one day to pray for peace and rest', '6engage yourself in good thoughts and deeds', 'people hug brass pots and take them to be gold but they have to polish them so that they may appear bright one day they will get disgusted with this constant polishing and scrubbing they will pray release me from this scrubbing this birth this suffering and this agony life is short time is fleeting your spiritual practice is creeping at tortoise speed when will you decide to proceed a little faster your spiritual practice is like the answers you write at the examination if you get only 5 or 6 marks the examiner will strike out even that saying what is the use of these few marks it will take you neither here nor there if you get somewhere near the passing marks then grace will give you just a little more so that you may pass provided you have been a diligent well behaved student', 'engage yourselves in good deeds good company and good thoughts fix your attention on the goal you have not realised yet the secret of this advent you are indeed lucky more fortunate than many others it is only when yasoda found every length of rope a little short to go round his belly that she discovered that he was the lord so to you will realise every description of my divine glory a little too short of the actuality and then you will get convinced meanwhile if you study the spiritual texts and know the characteristics of the avatar of the lord you might get a glimpse of the truth regarding me', '7you will know the truth when you experience', 'there is no use arguing and quarrelling among yourselves examine experience then you will know the truth do not proclaim before you are convinced be silent while you are still undecided or engaged in evaluating of course you must discard all evil in you before you can attempt to evaluate the mystery and when faith dawns fence it around with discipline and selfcontrol so that the tender shoot might be guarded against the goats and cattle the motley crowd of cynics and unbelievers when your faith grows into a big tree those very cattle can lie down in the shade that it will spread']\n"
